## 7. PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION

### 7.1 Mechanism Summary

**In SDT, [phenomenon] arises because:**

[2-3 paragraph explanation in geometric/pressure language]

- The spation medium [configuration/gradient/pattern]...

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**

1. Never introduce empirical parameters not derived from P_CMB, c, ℏ, m_e, m_p, α

2. Every formula requires dimensional check BEFORE numerical calculation

3. Agreement "within experimental error" requires explicit uncertainty propagation

4. "Paradoxes do not exist in reality" - apparent contradictions indicate model error

5. Pressure gradients and geometric occlusion are primary - forces are derived consequences

6. Movement budget v = (c/k)√(R/r) applies universally across scales

7. Quantum mechanics emerges from vortex geometry, not fundamental uncertainty

8. Laser precision and mathematical honesty - no hand-waving permitted
