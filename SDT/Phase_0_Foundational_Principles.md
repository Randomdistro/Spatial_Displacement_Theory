## Document Purpose

This document serves as the **"Principia" of SDT**—the definitive foundational document that establishes the complete ontological, mathematical, and physical framework from which all other SDT phases emerge.

**Primary Goals:**
1. Establish the four fundamental ingredients (Space, Matter, Movement, Now) with precise definitions
2. Reveal time as emergent from oscillation count, not fundamental
3. Explain shunt dynamics as the universal mechanism underlying all interactions
4. Demonstrate simulation vs. abstraction — why SDT represents reality rather than modeling it
5. Provide complete derivation tree from ingredients to all observables
6. Serve as roadmap connecting to all other phases
7. Replace quantum/relativistic/thermodynamic frameworks with unified geometric foundation

## Quick Reference: The Four Ingredients

### 1. **SPACE (Spation)**
- **What it is:** Incompressible medium filling all space
- **Properties:** Incompressible, deformable, fills all space, supports propagation at c
- **Key parameter:** K_bulk = 4.6×10¹¹³ Pa (bulk modulus)
- **Mathematical:** Pressure field Π(x) = ∫ I_∞(n̂)[1 - E(x,n̂)] dΩ

### 2. **MATTER (Displacement)**
- **What it is:** Geometric structures excluding spation volume
- **Properties:** Toroidal vortices, stable boundaries, creates pressure deficits
- **Key parameter:** V_disp (displacement volume)
- **Mathematical:** ΔΠ = -κV_disp K_bulk/(4πr²)

### 3. **MOVEMENT (Shunt Dynamics)**
- **What it is:** Micro-collisions between boundaries and spation
- **Properties:** RESISTANCE → RECOIL → TRANSFERENCE
- **Key parameter:** ν_shunt (shunt frequency)
- **Mathematical:** ν = v/λ_C, E = hν, F = ν⟨Δp⟩

### 4. **NOW (Time Emergence)**
- **What it is:** Counting of oscillations, not fundamental flow
- **Properties:** t = N_shunts/ν, no universal time
- **Key insight:** Time begins when matter begins
- **Mathematical:** t = N/ν, τ = ∫ dN/ν(local)

---

## Key Derivation: Time Emergence

**Starting point:**
$$v = \nu \times \lambda_C$$

**Rearrange:**
$$\nu = \frac{v}{\lambda_C}$$

**Express as count:**
$$N_{\text{shunts}} = \nu \times t$$

**Solve for time:**
$$\boxed{t = \frac{N_{\text{shunts}}}{\nu} = N_{\text{shunts}} \times T_{\text{shunt}}}$$

**Physical meaning:** Time is literally the count of how many shunts have occurred.

## Stable Orbits: The Exception

**The Problem:** Why don't electrons radiate in circular orbits?

**The Answer:** Circular orbits are **non-shunting motion**:
- Tangential velocity matches spation flow
- No head-on collisions
- Net shunts average to zero
- **No energy loss, stable indefinitely**

**Quantization emerges:** Only orbits with integer wave crests are stable.

---

## Thermodynamics: Shunt Statistics

**Heat** = random shunt energy transfer  
**Temperature** = synchronized shunt frequency  
**Entropy** = configuration count of shunt states  
**Arrow of time** = counting direction (monotonic increase)

**Three Laws:**
1. **First Law:** Energy conservation from shunt momentum conservation
2. **Second Law:** Entropy increases because oscillation count increases
3. **Third Law:** S → 0 as T → 0 (ground state, one configuration)

## Philosophical Foundations

### Simulation vs. Abstraction

**Conventional Physics (Abstraction):**
- Mathematical formalism predicts observations
- Doesn't represent actual events
- Result: Multiple incompatible frameworks

**SDT (Simulation):**
- Describes actual physical events
- Simulates these events
- Predictions emerge from simulation
- Result: ONE framework for all scales

### Ontological Clarity

SDT answers:
- **What is matter?** Displacement structures
- **What is energy?** Oscillation frequency
- **What is mass?** Shunt resistance (emergent)
- **What is time?** Oscillation counting (emergent)
- **What is force?** Directional shunt accumulation
- **What is temperature?** Synchronized oscillation frequency

**No mysteries. All mechanical. All geometric. All real.**
