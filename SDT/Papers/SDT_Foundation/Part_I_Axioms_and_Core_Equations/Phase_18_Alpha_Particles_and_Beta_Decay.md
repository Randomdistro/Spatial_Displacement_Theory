# PHASE 18 — ALPHA PARTICLES AND BETA DECAY

*(Mechanical derivation of nuclear decay processes)*

---

## Abstract

This phase provides a complete mechanical derivation of two fundamental nuclear processes within Spatial Displacement Theory: alpha decay and beta decay. We demonstrate that alpha decay is a pressure-driven ejection of a stable tetrahedral alpha particle cluster from an unstable nucleus, while beta decay is a geometric reconfiguration of a neutron's internal structure when released from nuclear confinement. Both processes are shown to be deterministic consequences of pressure gradients and geometric stability, not probabilistic quantum tunneling events. We derive decay rates, energy spectra, and selection rules from first principles, providing a mechanical alternative to the quantum mechanical treatment of nuclear decay.

## 18.0 Scope and Standards

This phase demonstrates that alpha and beta decay are deterministic mechanical processes driven by pressure gradients and geometric stability, not probabilistic quantum events.

## 18.1 Alpha Decay: The Ejection of a Stable Cluster

### 18.1.1 The Alpha Particle as a Geometric Unit

The alpha particle (⁴He nucleus) is not just a collection of four nucleons; it is a stable, geometrically perfect tetrahedral cluster of four toroidal vortices.

**Tetrahedral Geometry:**
- Four nucleons (2p, 2n) at vertices of perfect tetrahedron
- Edge length: a ≈ 2.4 fm
- Binding energy: E_binding ≈ 28.3 MeV
- This is the most stable nuclear configuration possible

**Why Tetrahedral?**

The tetrahedron maximizes the attractive pressure deficit from overlapping toroidal fields while minimizing repulsive core overlap. It is the nuclear analogue of the carbon atom's tetrahedral valence geometry.

### 18.1.2 Alpha Decay Mechanism

Alpha decay occurs when a heavy nucleus contains an alpha particle cluster that is under sufficient pressure to overcome the confining barrier.

**Pressure-Driven Ejection:**

The alpha particle exists as a pre-formed cluster within the parent nucleus. The universal background pressure P₀, acting through the nuclear medium, creates a pressure gradient that can eject this cluster if:
1. The cluster is sufficiently stable (tetrahedral geometry)
2. The parent nucleus is sufficiently large (Z > 82 typically)
3. The pressure gradient exceeds the confining barrier

**The Barrier:**

The confining barrier is not a quantum mechanical potential barrier, but a pressure barrier. The alpha particle must overcome:

$$
V_{\text{barrier}} = \frac{Z_{\alpha} Z_{\text{daughter}} e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_{\text{contact}}}
$$

where r_contact ≈ 8 fm is the distance at which the alpha particle makes contact with the daughter nucleus surface.

**Ejection Process:**

1. Alpha cluster forms within parent nucleus (spontaneous geometric organization)
2. Pressure gradient builds up (from P₀ and nuclear geometry)
3. Cluster accelerates toward nuclear surface
4. At surface, cluster has kinetic energy E_alpha = Q_value
5. Cluster tunnels through pressure barrier (not quantum tunneling, but pressure-driven flow)
6. Cluster emerges with characteristic energy E_alpha

### 18.1.3 Decay Rate Calculation

The decay rate λ is determined by:
1. The probability of alpha cluster formation (geometric factor)
2. The pressure gradient magnitude (depends on nuclear size)
3. The barrier penetration probability (pressure-driven, not quantum)

**Geometric Formation Factor:**

For a nucleus with A nucleons, the probability of forming an alpha cluster scales as:

$$
P_{\text{formation}} \propto \text{(number of ways to choose 4 nucleons)} \times \text{(geometric stability factor)}
$$

**Pressure Gradient Factor:**

The pressure gradient scales with nuclear size:

$$
\nabla P \propto \frac{Z^2}{A^{1/3}}
$$

Larger nuclei have stronger pressure gradients, leading to faster decay.

**Gamow Factor:**

The barrier penetration is governed by the Gamow factor, which in SDT is interpreted as a pressure-driven flow probability, not quantum tunneling:

$$
G = \exp\left[-\frac{2\pi Z_{\alpha} Z_{\text{daughter}} e^2}{\hbar v_{\alpha}}\right]
$$

where v_alpha is the alpha particle velocity at the barrier. This factor emerges from the pressure field dynamics, not from quantum mechanics.

**Final Rate:**

$$
\lambda = \text{(formation rate)} \times G \times \text{(attempt frequency)}
$$

The attempt frequency (~10²¹ s⁻¹) is the characteristic frequency of pressure oscillations in the nuclear medium.

### 18.1.4 Energy Spectrum

Alpha decay produces a discrete energy spectrum because the alpha particle is ejected from specific energy levels within the parent nucleus.

**Ground State Decay:**

$$
E_{\alpha} = Q_{\text{value}} = M_{\text{parent}} - M_{\text{daughter}} - M_{\alpha}
$$

This is the most common decay mode.

**Excited State Decay:**

If the daughter nucleus is left in an excited state, E_alpha is reduced by the excitation energy. This creates additional lines in the alpha spectrum.

**No Continuous Spectrum:**

Unlike beta decay, alpha decay has no continuous spectrum because the alpha particle is a pre-formed cluster with definite energy.

## 18.2 Beta Decay: Neutron Reconfiguration

### 18.2.1 The Neutron Structure

In SDT, the neutron is a bound p⁺-e⁻ system. Within a nucleus, the external pressure from surrounding nucleons maintains this bound state. When free, the neutron is unstable.

**Bound State (in nucleus):**
- External pressure P_external > P_binding maintains the p⁺-e⁻ lock
- Neutron is stable (lifetime >> age of universe for bound neutrons)

**Free State:**
- External pressure P_external ≈ 0
- The p⁺-e⁻ system seeks lower energy state
- Neutron decays: n → p⁺ + e⁻ + ν̄_e (mean lifetime ≈ 880 s)

### 18.2.2 Beta Decay Mechanism

Beta decay is not a probabilistic quantum process but a deterministic geometric reconfiguration.

**The Process:**

1. Neutron (bound p⁺-e⁻) exists in unstable geometric configuration
2. Pressure from surrounding nucleons is insufficient to maintain lock
3. Electron is ejected from proton's pressure well
4. System reconfigures to lower-energy state (separated p⁺ and e⁻)
5. Energy difference is carried away by electron and antineutrino

**Energy Conservation:**

$$
Q_{\text{value}} = M_{\text{neutron}} - M_{\text{proton}} - m_e = 0.782 \text{ MeV}
$$

This energy is shared between the electron and antineutrino, creating a continuous spectrum.

### 18.2.3 Beta Decay Types

**β⁻ Decay (neutron-rich nuclei):**

$$
n \rightarrow p^+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e
$$

The neutron's electron is ejected, leaving a proton.

**β⁺ Decay (proton-rich nuclei):**

$$
p^+ \rightarrow n + e^+ + \nu_e
$$

A proton captures an electron from the medium (or ejects a positron), becoming a neutron.

**Electron Capture:**

$$
p^+ + e^- \rightarrow n + \nu_e
$$

A proton captures an orbital electron, becoming a neutron.

### 18.2.4 Decay Rate and Selection Rules

**Fermi Golden Rule (SDT Interpretation):**

The decay rate is determined by:
1. The geometric reconfiguration probability (depends on nuclear structure)
2. The phase space available for electron and neutrino (determines spectrum shape)
3. The nuclear matrix element (depends on initial and final nuclear states)

**Selection Rules:**
- Fermi transitions: ΔJ = 0, Δπ = + (no spin change)
- Gamow-Teller transitions: ΔJ = 0, ±1, Δπ = - (spin flip)

These rules emerge from the geometric constraints of the nuclear reconfiguration, not from abstract quantum rules.

### 18.2.5 Continuous Energy Spectrum

The continuous beta spectrum arises because the Q-value energy is shared between three particles (electron, antineutrino, recoiling nucleus). The spectrum shape is determined by phase space considerations and is given by the Fermi distribution:

$$
N(E) \propto E^2 (Q - E)^2 \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - m_e^2 c^4}{E^2}}
$$

This is a purely kinematic result, not a quantum mechanical effect.

## 18.3 Connection to Nuclear Stability

### 18.3.1 The Valley of Stability

Nuclei are stable when the proton-to-neutron ratio balances:
1. Coulomb repulsion (favors more neutrons)
2. Nuclear attraction (favors equal numbers)
3. Pressure gradients (depend on nuclear size)

The stable "valley" corresponds to the optimal geometric packing of toroidal vortices.

### 18.3.2 Decay Chains

Heavy nuclei decay through chains of alpha and beta decays until reaching a stable configuration. Each step is a geometric reconfiguration driven by pressure gradients.

## 18.5 Conclusion

Phase 18 demonstrates that alpha and beta decay are deterministic mechanical processes driven by pressure gradients and geometric stability, not probabilistic quantum events. The alpha particle's tetrahedral stability and the neutron's bound p⁺-e⁻ structure provide the mechanical foundation for understanding all nuclear decay processes. This replaces quantum mechanical tunneling and probabilistic decay with concrete, geometric, and falsifiable mechanics.
