# PHASE 17 — TOROIDAL STRUCTURES AND PRESSURE DIFFERENTIALS AT FEMTOSCALE

*(Nuclear structure from toroidal vortex geometry)*

---

## Abstract

The nuclear scale (femtometer, 10⁻¹⁵ m) represents a critical transition in Spatial Displacement Theory, where the geometric structures of nucleons (protons and neutrons) must be understood as toroidal vortices in the spation medium. This phase establishes the mechanical foundation for nuclear structure by deriving the toroidal geometry of nucleons, the pressure differentials that maintain their stability, and the relationship between nuclear size and the universal background pressure P₀. We demonstrate that nucleons are not point particles but stable, toroidal displacement structures with characteristic radii R_p ≈ 0.84 fm and R_n ≈ 0.8 fm, held together by pressure gradients that scale with the spation bulk modulus K_bulk. This mechanical model provides the foundation for understanding nuclear binding, decay processes, and the origin of nuclear forces.

## 17.1 The Toroidal Vortex Model of Nucleons

### 17.1.1 Physical Structure of the Proton

In SDT, the proton is not a point charge but a stable, toroidal vortex structure in the spation medium. This toroidal geometry arises from the self-confinement principle: the proton's displacement of the spation medium creates a pressure gradient that maintains its structural integrity.

**Geometric Parameters:**
- Proton radius: R_p = 0.8414(19) fm (CODATA 2018, from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy)
- Toroidal structure: The proton forms a donut-shaped (torus) displacement region
- Major radius: R_torus ≈ R_p ≈ 0.84 fm
- Minor radius: r_torus ≈ R_p/3 ≈ 0.28 fm (estimated from vortex stability constraints)

**Physical Interpretation:**

The toroidal structure is the lowest-energy configuration for a stable, rotating displacement vortex. The rotation creates a helical wake (magnetic field), while the toroidal geometry minimizes the surface area-to-volume ratio, reducing the energy required to maintain the displacement against the universal background pressure P₀.

### 17.1.2 Physical Structure of the Neutron

The neutron, in SDT, is a composite structure: a proton and an electron brought into such close proximity (under immense nuclear pressure) that their displacement fields merge. The neutron's toroidal structure is similar to the proton's but with a slightly different geometry due to the internal electron binding.

**Geometric Parameters:**
- Neutron radius: R_n ≈ 0.8 fm (approximate, no charge for direct measurement)
- Structure: Bound p⁺-e⁻ system in toroidal configuration
- The electron is trapped in the proton's pressure well, creating a "sprung gear on standby" configuration

**Stability Mechanism:**

The neutron is stable within a nucleus because the external pressure from surrounding nucleons maintains the geometric lock. When free, the neutron decays (mean lifetime ≈ 880 s) as the system finds a path to the lower-energy state of a separated proton and electron.

### 17.1.3 Pressure Differentials at Femtoscale

The pressure field around a nucleon follows the SDT master equation, but at femtoscale, the geometry is toroidal rather than spherical.

**Toroidal Pressure Field:**

For a toroidal vortex of major radius R_t and minor radius r_t, the pressure field at distance d from the torus center is:

$$
P(d) = P_0 \left[1 - \frac{R_t^2 r_t^2}{4d^4}\right] \quad \text{for } d \gg R_t
$$

This is the toroidal analogue of the spherical pressure field. The 1/d⁴ falloff (rather than 1/d²) reflects the more complex geometry of the torus.

**Pressure Gradient:**

The pressure gradient ∇P creates the confining force:

$$
F_{\text{confine}} = -\nabla P \cdot A_{\text{cross-section}}
$$

For the proton, this yields the Strong Nuclear Force strength (~1.77 × 10⁵ N) as derived in Section 2.2.

## 17.2 Nuclear Packing and Pressure Interactions

### 17.2.1 Nucleon-Nucleon Interactions

When two nucleons approach within nuclear distances (d < 3 fm), their toroidal pressure fields overlap, creating a complex pressure landscape.

**Attractive Region:**

At intermediate distances (1-2 fm), the overlapping pressure fields create a region of reduced pressure between the nucleons. This pressure deficit creates an attractive force, which is the mechanical origin of the nuclear force.

**Repulsive Core:**

At very short distances (d < 0.5 fm), the toroidal structures themselves begin to overlap, creating a region of increased pressure. This repulsive core prevents nucleons from collapsing into each other.

**The Nuclear Potential:**

The resulting potential has the characteristic shape:

$$
V(r) = -V_0 e^{-r/r_0} + V_{\text{repulsive}} e^{-r/r_{\text{core}}}
$$

where V₀ ≈ 50 MeV, r₀ ≈ 1.4 fm, and r_core ≈ 0.5 fm. This is the SDT mechanical origin of the phenomenological nuclear potential.

### 17.2.2 Nuclear Matter Density

The packing of nucleons in a nucleus follows similar principles to atomic packing, but at much higher density.

**Nuclear Radius Formula:**

$$
R_N = r_0 A^{1/3} \quad \text{where } r_0 \approx 1.2 \text{ fm}
$$

This empirical formula reflects the constant density of nuclear matter: each nucleon occupies approximately the same volume (~7 fm³).

**SDT Interpretation:**

The nuclear radius is determined by the balance between:
1. The attractive pressure deficit from overlapping toroidal fields
2. The repulsive core from toroidal structure overlap
3. The universal background pressure P₀

The r₀ ≈ 1.2 fm value emerges from this balance, giving nuclear matter its characteristic density ρ_nuclear ≈ 2.3 × 10¹⁷ kg/m³.

## 17.3 Toroidal Vortex Stability

### 17.3.1 Rotational Stability

The toroidal structure is stabilized by rotation. The proton's intrinsic spin (ℏ/2) corresponds to a rotational velocity at the torus surface:

$$
v_{\text{rotation}} = \frac{\hbar/2}{m_p R_p} \approx 0.6c
$$

This high rotational velocity creates the helical wake (magnetic field) and maintains the toroidal geometry against pressure-driven collapse.

### 17.3.2 Pressure Balance

The toroidal vortex is stable when the internal pressure from rotation balances the external pressure from P₀:

$$
P_{\text{rotation}} = \frac{m_p v_{\text{rotation}}^2}{2\pi R_{\text{torus}} r_{\text{torus}}} \approx P_0
$$

This balance determines the stable toroidal dimensions. The proton's measured radius R_p ≈ 0.84 fm is the result of this pressure balance.

## 17.4 Connection to Nuclear Binding

### 17.4.1 Alpha Particle Structure

The alpha particle (⁴He nucleus) is exceptionally stable because it represents a perfect geometric packing of four toroidal vortices (two protons, two neutrons) in a tetrahedral arrangement.

**Tetrahedral Packing:**

The four nucleons arrange themselves at the vertices of a tetrahedron, with edge length ≈ 2.4 fm. This maximizes the attractive pressure deficit while minimizing repulsive overlap.

**Binding Energy:**

The alpha particle's binding energy (~28 MeV) is the energy released when four separate nucleons form this stable tetrahedral configuration. This is a direct calculation from the pressure field overlap.

### 17.4.2 Nuclear Shell Structure

The magic numbers (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126) correspond to stable geometric packings of toroidal vortices. These are the nuclear analogues of the atomic noble gas configurations.

**Geometric Interpretation:**

Each magic number represents a complete geometric shell of toroidal vortices. For example:
- N = 2: Linear dyad (deuteron)
- N = 8: Cubic arrangement (doubly magic nuclei like ⁴He, ¹⁶O)
- N = 20: Icosahedral arrangement

## 17.5 Experimental Predictions

### 17.5.1 Nuclear Charge Distribution

The toroidal model predicts a specific charge distribution within the nucleus, measurable via electron scattering.

**Prediction:**

The charge density should peak at the torus center and fall off with a characteristic length scale r_torus ≈ 0.28 fm.

### 17.5.2 Magnetic Moment Anomalies

The toroidal geometry affects the magnetic moment calculation, potentially explaining deviations from the simple quark model predictions.

### 17.5.3 Nuclear Deformation

Nuclei with non-spherical shapes (prolate/oblate) correspond to deformed toroidal clusters. The quadrupole moment Q is a direct measure of this deformation.

## 17.6 Conclusion

Phase 17 establishes the toroidal vortex model as the mechanical foundation for nuclear structure in SDT. The femtoscale pressure differentials, governed by the universal background pressure P₀ and the spation bulk modulus K_bulk, create stable toroidal structures that explain nuclear binding, decay, and the origin of nuclear forces. This mechanical model replaces the abstract quantum chromodynamics with a concrete, geometric, and falsifiable framework.
