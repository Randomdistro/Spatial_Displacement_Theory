# Atomic Atlas Investigation Prompt

*Element-by-element investigation of atomic structure from SDT*

**Status:** Under development  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Objective

Systematically validate SDT atomic structure predictions across the periodic table, element by element.

---

## Investigation Framework

### For Each Element:

1. **Single-electron systems** (H, He⁺, Li²⁺, etc.)
   - Rydberg formula validation
   - Fine structure splitting
   - Hyperfine structure (where applicable)

2. **Multi-electron systems**
   - Screening factors from occlusion geometry
   - Ionization energies
   - Spectral line positions

3. **Comparison to NIST database**
   - Quantitative error analysis
   - Systematic trends identification

---

## Key Questions

- How does screening factor vary with Z?
- Do occlusion patterns explain periodic trends?
- Can SDT predict ionization energies without empirical fits?

---

## Data Sources

- NIST Atomic Spectra Database
- `data/atomic_spectra_nist.csv` (under development)
