## Core Concepts

### Spation
The incompressible medium that fills space. All matter is displacement of spation.

### Displacement Density (ρ_disp)
The volume density of matter excluding spation. Represents how much spation is displaced at a given location.

### Occlusion Function (E(x,n̂))
Directional occlusion function representing mutual shadowing between particles. Determines how much pressure is blocked in direction n̂ at position x.

### Ϟ (Kappa) Factor
Velocity factor: Ϟ = c/v_surface, where v_surface is the orbital velocity at reference radius R.

### ϟ (Koppa) - c-Boundary Position
Geometric locus where local tangential speed reaches c. Related to Ϟ by: ϟ = R/Ϟ²

## Key Parameters

### K_bulk
Bulk modulus of spation (4.6×10¹¹³ Pa)

### β (Beta)
Gravitational parameter: β = κ V_disp c²/(4π). Replaces GM in orbital mechanics.

### ξ (Xi)
Screening factor: ξ = N_eff/N_total. Explains why gravity is weak (~10⁻⁹).

### κ (Kappa)
Geometric efficiency parameter, typically ≈ 1.

Energy levels En = -13.6 eV/n² from helical standing waves

### B3: Fine Structure
Splittings matching Dirac equation

### B5: Hyperfine Structure
21 cm line (1420.405 MHz) from magnetic moment overlap

### B7: k-Law Universality
v(r) = (c/k)√(R/r) from atoms to galaxies

### B20: z·k² = 1
Universal relationship for continuous mass distributions
