## Introduction to Book 14

This book presents strong-field gravitational effects and gravitational waves as pressure phenomena. All effects arise from nonlinear pressure gradients and propagating pressure pulses.

**Key Principle:**
- Strong fields = large pressure gradients
- Gravitational waves = pressure pulses at speed c
- Black holes = pressure horizons

**Cross-Reference:** This book completes Volume V, building on Book 12 (Gravitational Mechanics) and Book 13 (Orbital Dynamics).

## Chapter 1: Strong-Field Effects

### Section 1.1: Nonlinear Pressure Gradients

For strong fields (β/r large), pressure gradient becomes nonlinear:

$$\nabla^2 \Pi_s = -\rho_{\text{source}} + \frac{(\nabla \Pi_s)^2}{K_{\text{bulk}}} \tag{V.14.1.1.1}$$

Second term creates additional acceleration:

$$a_{\text{nonlinear}} = -\frac{3\beta^2}{2c^2 r^3} \tag{V.14.1.1.2}$$

This contributes to perihelion precession (see Book 12, Chapter 4).

### Section 1.2: Black Holes as Pressure Horizons

When pressure gradient becomes extreme:

$$\frac{\beta}{r^2} \sim c^2 \tag{V.14.1.2.1}$$

Define Schwarzschild radius:

$$r_S = \frac{2\beta}{c^2} \tag{V.14.1.2.2}$$

At r = r_S: Pressure gradient creates horizon where spation flow becomes trapped.

SDT interpretation: Black hole = region where pressure deficit prevents spation escape.

## Chapter 2: Gravitational Waves

### Section 2.1: Wave Equation

Time-varying displacement creates propagating pressure waves:

$$\nabla^2 \Pi_s - \frac{1}{c^2}\frac{\partial^2\Pi_s}{\partial t^2} = -\frac{\partial^2 \rho_{\text{source}}}{\partial t^2} \tag{V.14.2.1.1}$$

For oscillating binary system: Quadrupole moment creates radiation.

### Section 2.2: Radiated Power

For binary system with orbital frequency ω:

$$P_{\text{GW}} = \frac{32}{5c^5}\frac{(\beta_1 + \beta_2)^{10/3}}{a^5}\frac{f(e)}{(1-e^2)^{7/2}} \tag{V.14.2.2.1}$$

where:
- a = semi-major axis
- e = eccentricity
- f(e) = geometric factor

SDT: Power radiated from pressure-wave momentum flux.

### Section 2.3: Wave Polarization

Pressure waves have both transverse and longitudinal components:

$$h_{\parallel} / h_{\perp} \sim 0.1 \tag{V.14.2.3.1}$$

GR: Pure transverse (h_∥ = 0).

Test: Three-arm LISA or resonant bar tuned to breathing mode.

Status: Future mission (2030s).

## Chapter 3: Falsifiable Predictions

### Section 3.1: Test Summary

| Test | Observable | SDT Prediction | GR | Status |
|------|------------|----------------|-----|--------|
| G2 | Light deflection dispersion | θ(λ) varies | Constant | New |
| G3 | Lunar eclipse anomaly | δr(t) modulation | 0 | New |
| G4 | GW longitudinal mode | h_∥/h_⊥ ~ 0.1 | 0 | New |
| G5 | Neutron interferometry | Quantized phase | Smooth | New |
| G9 | GW speed | v_GW/c = 1 | Same | Verified |
| G10 | Binary decay | dP/dt | Matches GR | Verified |

### Section 3.2: Key New Predictions

**Test G2: Chromatic Light Deflection**

Prediction: Deflection angle varies with wavelength:

$$\theta(\lambda) = \theta_0\left[1 + \frac{dn}{d\lambda}\frac{\lambda}{\beta}\right] \tag{V.14.3.2.1}$$

For solar limb: Δθ ~ 0.003" over visible spectrum.

GR: Predicts zero dispersion.

**Test G3: Lunar Eclipse Gravitational Anomaly**

Prediction: During solar eclipse, Earth-Moon distance shows modulation:

$$\delta r(t) = -\frac{E_{\text{mutual}}(t)}{2}\frac{\beta_⊕}{v_{\text{orbit}}^2} \tag{V.14.3.2.2}$$

At eclipse maximum: δr ~ 0.4 nm.

GR: No eclipse-specific signal.

**Test G4: Gravitational Wave Longitudinal Mode**

Prediction: Pressure waves have longitudinal component:

$$h_{\parallel} / h_{\perp} \sim 0.1 \tag{V.14.3.2.3}$$

GR: Pure transverse.
