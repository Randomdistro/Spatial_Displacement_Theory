## Coordination Rules

### 1. **Shared Terminology**
All agents must use consistent terminology:
- **Spation** (not "ether" or "medium")
- **Displacement** (not "matter" or "particles")
- **Shunt** (not "collision" or "interaction")
- **Occlusion** E(x,n̂) (not "shadowing" or "blocking")

### 2. **Mathematical Notation**
- Pressure: Π(x) [Pa]
- Displacement volume: V_disp [m³]
- Bulk modulus: K_bulk [Pa]
- Shunt frequency: ν [Hz]
- Occlusion function: E(x,n̂) [dimensionless]

### 3. **Cross-Reference Format**
When referencing other agents' work:
```markdown
**Cross-Reference:** See Agent 1, Chapter 1.2 (K_bulk) for derivation.
```

### 4. **Integration Points**
Each agent marks integration points:
```markdown
**[INTEGRATION POINT: Agent X]**
This section builds on: [list dependencies]
```

### 5. **Status Updates**
Each agent includes status at top:
```markdown
**Status:** Under Development | Complete | Needs Review
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Word Count:** [Approximate]
```

## Final Integration Plan

After all 4 agents complete their sections:

1. **Merge into single document:** `Phase_0_Foundational_Principles.md`
2. **Resolve cross-references:** Convert "Agent X" references to section numbers
3. **Unify notation:** Ensure consistent symbols throughout
4. **Complete derivation tree:** Verify all paths from ingredients to observables
5. **Final review:** Check for contradictions, gaps, inconsistencies

**Integration Checklist:**
- [ ] All 4 parts complete
- [ ] Cross-references resolved
- [ ] Notation unified
- [ ] Derivation tree complete
- [ ] No contradictions
- [ ] All equations dimensionally verified
- [ ] All numerical examples checked
- [ ] Appendices complete
- [ ] Glossary cross-referenced
