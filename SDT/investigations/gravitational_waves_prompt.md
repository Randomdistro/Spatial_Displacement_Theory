# Gravitational Waves Investigation Prompt

*LIGO/LISA analysis framework for SDT pressure wave predictions*

**Status:** Under development  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Objective

Test SDT prediction that gravitational waves have both transverse and longitudinal components, unlike GR's pure transverse waves.

---

## Key Prediction

SDT predicts pressure waves with both transverse and longitudinal modes:

**h_∥ / h_⊥ ~ 0.1**

GR predicts: **h_∥ = 0** (pure transverse)

---

## Investigation Steps

1. **Theoretical calculation**
   - Pressure wave modes from master equation
   - Polarization patterns
   - Amplitude ratios

2. **LIGO data analysis**
   - Reanalyze existing events
   - Search for longitudinal component
   - Statistical significance

3. **LISA predictions**
   - Three-arm configuration sensitivity
   - Expected signal-to-noise ratios
   - Detection prospects

## Data Sources

- LIGO Open Science Center
- LISA mission data (future)

## Falsification Criteria

If LIGO/LISA observations show no longitudinal component (h_∥ = 0 within measurement precision), SDT pressure mechanism fails.
