# Nuclear Structure Investigation Prompt

*Superluminal binding hypothesis for nuclear structure*

**Status:** Speculative - Under development  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Objective

Investigate SDT hypothesis that bound protons in nuclei orbit at v > c (10-100× faster than light) to generate strong binding.

---

## Key Hypothesis

**Superluminal nuclear velocities:** Bound protons in nuclei orbit at v > c.

**Why no causality violation?** c is the EM propagation limit, not a mechanical speed limit. Information still travels ≤ c.

---

## Investigation Steps

1. **Theoretical framework**
   - Nuclear binding from pressure gradients
   - Velocity calculations for nuclear orbits
   - Energy scales and force strengths

2. **Nuclear magnetic moments**
   - Predictions from superluminal circulation
   - Comparison to experimental data
   - Systematic trends

3. **Beta decay and weak interactions**
   - Connection to nuclear structure
   - SDT mechanism for β decay

---

## Data Sources

- Nuclear data tables
- Magnetic moment measurements
- Beta decay spectra

## Status

**Highly speculative.** This investigation explores an extreme regime of SDT. Current focus is on atomic and gravitational scales where theory is more established.

*This investigation is ongoing but lower priority. Results will be documented if validated.*
