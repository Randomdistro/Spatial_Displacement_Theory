## Introduction to Book 23

This book shows how SDT resolves historical paradoxes in physics.

**Cross-Reference:** This book builds on Volume IX, Book 22 (Simulation vs. Abstraction).

## Chapter 1: Resolution of Historical Paradoxes

### Section 1.1: Wave-Particle Duality

**Problem:** How can electron be both wave and particle?

**SDT Resolution:**

Electron is extended vortex (particle) that creates wave patterns (helical wake).

**Not duality—single entity with both properties.**

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume II, Book 4, Chapter 2 (Rydberg Spectrum) for helical standing waves.

### Section 1.2: Radiation Paradox

**Problem:** Accelerating charge should radiate, but stable orbits don't.

**SDT Resolution:**

Circular orbits are non-shunting (net shunts = 0).

**No radiation because no net energy transfer.**

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 3, Section 3.6 for non-shunting motion.

### Section 1.3: EPR / Bell's Theorem

**Problem:** Non-local correlations violate locality.

**SDT Resolution:**

Pressure coupling creates instantaneous correlations (no faster-than-light information).

**Correlations through incompressible medium, not information transfer.**

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 3, Section 3.2 for causal chains.

### Section 1.4: Information Paradox

**Problem:** Black holes destroy information.

**SDT Resolution:**

Black holes are pressure horizons, information preserved in pressure field.

**No information loss, just inaccessible.**

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume V, Book 14, Chapter 4 (Black Holes as Pressure Horizons).

### Section 1.5: Dark Matter Problem

**Problem:** 85% of universe is invisible matter.

**SDT Resolution:**

Disk eclipse saturation creates flat rotation curves without dark matter.

**No dark matter needed, geometric effect.**

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume VI, Book 15, Chapter 3 (Galactic Rotation Curves).

## Summary

**SDT resolves all major historical paradoxes:**

1. Wave-particle duality → Extended vortex with wave properties
2. Radiation paradox → Non-shunting circular motion
3. EPR/Bell → Pressure coupling through medium
4. Information paradox → Information in pressure field
5. Dark matter → Geometric eclipse saturation

**All resolved through mechanical geometry.**
