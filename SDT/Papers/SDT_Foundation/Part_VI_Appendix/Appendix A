Appendix A — Fundamental Equations of the Spation Medium (v1.2)

Objective. Define the mechanical field equations of the spation medium, its displacement under matter, and conservation of total movement, with dimensional consistency and closed flux forms.

A.0 Conventions (minimal but crucial)

Let t be the affine evolution parameter with units of time (seconds).

Let P(r,t) be the spation pressure (Pa = J·m⁻³).

Let ρₛ(r,t) be the effective spation density (kg·m⁻³).

Let v(r,t) be the spation velocity field (m·s⁻¹).

The characteristic transmission speed is c (m·s⁻¹) with barotropic closure c² = ∂P/∂ρₛ (sound-speed relation for the medium).

If you insist on using a non-time affine parameter s, set s = t (recommended), or define s = t explicitly; otherwise extra scale factors creep into the wave equation.

A.1 Continuity (well-posed)

Two equivalent, dimensionally clean options. Pick one and use it consistently.

Option 1 (mass-like continuity on ρₛ):

∂ρₛ/∂t + ∇·(ρₛ v) = 0

Option 2 (your “pressure continuity” recast on Π ≡ P/c²):
1′) ∂Π/∂t + ∇·(Π v) = 0, where Π ≡ P/c²

(Using Π fixes the units in your original ∂P/∂s + ∇·(P v) = 0.)

A.2 Pressure–acceleration coupling (as you wrote, dimensionally OK)

∇P = −ρₛ a, with a ≡ Dv/Dt (material acceleration)

Integral (with the correct sign and vector form):
3) ∮ P n dA = − ∫_V ρₛ a dV

(Your draft missed the minus sign and vector notation on the surface integral.)

A.3 Wave propagation of the medium (small-perturbation limit)

Linearizing about a uniform state (ρₛ₀,P₀) with barotropic closure c² = ∂P/∂ρₛ:

∇²P − (1/c²) ∂²P/∂t² = 0

(This is your Eq. (4) but now with t as the evolution variable; no extra scale factors.)

A.4 Movement-budget (energy-like) conservation in flux form

Define the “movement density” 𝓑 and its flux 𝓕 (inviscid, source-free):

𝓑 ≡ ½ ρₛ |v|² + U(P), with dU/dP = 1/ρₛ (barotropic internal-movement term)
𝓕 ≡ (½ ρₛ |v|² + h) v, where h ≡ U + P/ρₛ (specific enthalpy)

Then the local conservation law is:
5) ∂𝓑/∂t + ∇·𝓕 = 0

If you prefer your original “all energy is kinetic” statement, you can set U(P) ≡ P (in units where ρₛ is normalized) but keep the ½ in the kinetic part and the flux divergence structure; dropping them breaks standard balances.

A.5 Matter boundary (exclusion) conditions

Let Ω_M be the matter region (spation excluded). On ∂Ω_M:

6a) P|_{∂Ω_M} = P₀ + ΔP_M
6b) n·∇P = −κ_M P₀

Dimensions: [n·∇P] = Pa·m⁻¹; [κ_M P₀] = m⁻¹·Pa → consistent.

A.6 Summary (drop-in index)

(1) ∂ρₛ/∂t + ∇·(ρₛ v) = 0 or ∂(P/c²)/∂t + ∇·[(P/c²) v] = 0

(2) ∇P = −ρₛ a

(3) ∮ P n dA = − ∫_V ρₛ a dV

(4) ∇²P − (1/c²) ∂²P/∂t² = 0

(5) ∂/∂t [½ ρₛ|v|² + U(P)] + ∇·[(½ ρₛ|v|² + h) v] = 0, with h = U + P/ρₛ

(6) P|_{∂Ω_M} = P₀ + ΔP_M, n·∇P = −κ_M P₀

These are now dimensionally homogeneous, have the right global signs, and reduce to your original forms under the intended assumptions. They also dovetail cleanly with your orbital results (z·k² = 1) once you specialize to steady, spherically symmetric configurations.
