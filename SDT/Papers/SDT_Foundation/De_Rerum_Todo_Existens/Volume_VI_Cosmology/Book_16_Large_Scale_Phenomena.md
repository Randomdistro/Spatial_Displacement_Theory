## Introduction to Book 16

This book presents large-scale phenomena from spation pressure mechanics. Flat galactic rotation curves emerge from disk eclipse saturation, requiring no dark matter.

**Key Principle:**
- Flat rotation curves = E(r) saturation for disk geometry
- No dark matter needed
- Pressure differentials across scales

**Cross-Reference:** This book completes Volume VI, building on Book 15 (Cosmic Structure) and connecting to Volume VII (Unification).

## Chapter 1: Galactic Rotation Curves from Disk Eclipse Saturation

### Section 1.1: The Central Hypothesis

Flat rotation curves are not a mass anomaly. They are an **E(x) geometry anomaly**.

**Specifically:**
- Inside some radius R_flat: E(r) changes rapidly → v(r) rises
- Beyond R_flat: E(r) ≈ constant → v(r) ≈ constant (flat)

**Why this happens:**
- Disk geometry creates fixed angular occlusion band
- Beyond disk scale length, additional radius doesn't increase occlusion
- Directional pressure deficit saturates
- Acceleration ∝ 1/r → v ∝ √(constant) = flat

### Section 1.2: Disk Eclipse Saturation

The directional occlusion integral:

$$\Pi(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{4\pi} I_\infty(\hat{\mathbf{n}}) \left[1 - \chi(\mathbf{x}, \hat{\mathbf{n}})\right] d\Omega \tag{VI.16.1.2.1}$$

For a disk galaxy:
- **In-plane directions (disk plane):** χ ≈ 1 (disk blocks CMB)
- **Vertical directions (above/below disk):** χ ≈ 0 (no blocking)
- **Key insight:** At large r, the disk subtends a **fixed angular band** regardless of radius

**Expected behavior:**

$$\boxed{E_{\text{disk}}(r) \to E_\infty = \text{constant} \quad \text{for } r > R_{\text{flat}}} \tag{VI.16.1.2.2}$$

This produces:
- Pressure gradient: ∇Π ≈ constant
- Acceleration: a(r) ∝ 1/r
- Velocity: v(r) = √(r·a) = constant ← **Flat rotation curve**

### Section 1.3: Connection to SDT Master Equation

From Volume V, the acceleration arises from:

$$\nabla \cdot [K_{\text{bulk}} \nabla \Delta] = -\kappa \rho_{\text{disp}} (1 - E) \tag{VI.16.1.3.1}$$

For disk geometry with E(r) → constant:
- Right-hand side: ∝ (1 - E_∞) = constant
- Left-hand side: ∇²Δ ∝ constant
- Solution: Δ ∝ r², so ∇Δ ∝ r
- Acceleration: a = -∇Δ ∝ 1/r
- Velocity: v = √(r·a) = constant ✓

## Chapter 2: Pressure Differentials Across Scales

### Section 2.1: Scale-Dependent Interactions

Pressure-mediated forces vary with scale:
- Atomic scale: Strong pressure gradients (Coulomb)
- Planetary scale: Moderate gradients (gravity)
- Galactic scale: Saturated gradients (flat rotation)
- Cosmic scale: Universal background (CMB)

### Section 2.2: Cross-Scale Coupling

Different scales interact through pressure field:
- Local structure affects global pressure
- Global pressure affects local dynamics
- Unified through SDT Master Equation
