## Introduction to Book 15

This book presents cosmic structure from universal c-boundary geometry. The Ϟ and ϟ parameters encode orbital dynamics and cosmic boundaries in a unified framework.

**Key Principle:**
- Ϟ = velocity factor (orbital speed as fraction of c)
- ϟ = c-boundary position (radius where v = c)
- Universal relationship: ϟ = R/Ϟ²

**Cross-Reference:** This book builds on Volume V (Gravitation) and connects to Volume VI, Book 16 (Large-Scale Phenomena).

## Chapter 1: Universal c-Boundary Geometry

### Section 1.1: Definitions

**Ϟ (velocity factor):** Dimensionless ratio encoding orbital speed as fraction of c.

At reference radius R (usually effective surface):

$$v(R) = \frac{c}{Ϟ} \tag{VI.15.1.1.1}$$

so that:

$$\frac{v(R)}{c} = \frac{1}{Ϟ} \quad \Rightarrow \quad Ϟ = \frac{c}{v(R)} \tag{VI.15.1.1.2}$$

**ϟ (c-boundary position):** Geometric locus (radius) where local tangential speed reaches c.

By definition, at radius r = ϟ:

$$v(ϟ) = c \tag{VI.15.1.1.3}$$

### Section 1.2: Orbital Law with Ϟ and ϟ

From Volume V, the SDT orbital law:

$$v(r) = \frac{c}{Ϟ} \sqrt{\frac{R}{r}} \tag{VI.15.1.2.1}$$

Imposing c-boundary condition v(ϟ) = c:

$$c = \frac{c}{Ϟ} \sqrt{\frac{R}{ϟ}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 = \frac{1}{Ϟ} \sqrt{\frac{R}{ϟ}} \tag{VI.15.1.2.2}$$

Solving for ϟ:

$$\sqrt{\frac{R}{ϟ}} = Ϟ \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R}{ϟ} = Ϟ^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{ϟ = \frac{R}{Ϟ^2}} \tag{VI.15.1.2.3}$$

**Key invariant:** For any parent body with surface orbital speed v(R) = c/Ϟ, the c-boundary radius is fixed by ϟ = R/Ϟ².

This relation is universal: holds for Sun, planets, compact objects, and any spherically scaled mass distribution.

### Section 1.3: Solar Example

For the Sun, using Ϟ_⊙ = 686.34:

$$v_{\text{surf},\odot} = \frac{c}{Ϟ_\odot} = \frac{2.998\times10^8\ \text{m/s}}{686.34} \approx 436.8\ \text{km/s} \tag{VI.15.1.3.1}$$

The corresponding c-boundary radius:

$$ϟ_\odot = \frac{R_\odot}{Ϟ_\odot^2} \sim 10^3\ \text{m} \tag{VI.15.1.3.2}$$

At r = ϟ_⊙, tangential speed required for circular orbit reaches c; inward of ϟ_⊙, strictly circular orbits are no longer physically possible.

## Chapter 2: CMB as Pressure Horizon

### Section 2.1: Cosmic Microwave Background

The CMB represents the boundary of last scattering - the densest region producing inward isotropic pressure.

**Pressure field:**

$$P_{\text{CMB}} = \text{constant at local scale} \tag{VI.15.2.1.1}$$

SDT interpretation: CMB = pressure horizon creating universal background pressure.

### Section 2.2: Universal Pressure Structure

From Volume I: Pressure originates from CMB boundary.

At local scales, pressure is effectively constant, creating uniform background for all local physics.

## Summary and Certification

### What Was Rigorously Derived

✓ Universal c-boundary geometry (Ϟ, ϟ)  
✓ Orbital law: v(r) = (c/Ϟ)√(R/r)  
✓ c-boundary position: ϟ = R/Ϟ²  
✓ CMB as pressure horizon  
✓ Cosmic structure from pressure geometry

### Key Achievements

**Universal geometry:**
- Ϟ and ϟ encode all orbital dynamics
- Universal relationship connects structure to dynamics
- CMB provides cosmic pressure background
