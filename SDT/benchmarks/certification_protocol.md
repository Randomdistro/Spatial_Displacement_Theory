# SDT Benchmark Certification Protocol

*Standards for validation and certification of SDT predictions*

**Status:** Under development  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

---

## Certification Criteria

A benchmark is **certified** when:

1. **Derived from SDT axioms** - No ad-hoc postulates or free parameters
2. **Quantitative agreement** - Matches experimental data within stated error tolerance
3. **Independent validation** - Verified against ≥3 independent sources
4. **Mechanistic explanation** - Clear geometric/pressure mechanism provided
5. **Falsifiable** - Specific predictions that could disprove SDT if wrong

## Error Tolerance Standards

| Scale | Typical Tolerance | Notes |
|-------|------------------|-------|
| Atomic (10⁻¹¹ m) | <0.1% | High-precision spectroscopy |
| Planetary (10⁶ m) | ±3% | GRACE/JPL ephemerides |
| Stellar (10¹² m) | ±5% | Exoplanet host star parameters |
| Galactic (10²¹ m) | ±10% | SPARC rotation curves |
| Cosmological (10²⁶ m) | Exact match | CMB redshift, BAO scale |

## Certification Process

1. **Derivation** - Complete SDT derivation from axioms
2. **Numerical calculation** - Quantitative prediction with error analysis
3. **Comparison** - Match against experimental data
4. **Documentation** - Write up in Phase document
5. **Review** - Independent verification
6. **Certification** - Mark as certified in tracking sheet

## Current Status

**Certified:** 15 of 24 benchmarks  
**Under Investigation:** 9 benchmarks  
**Not Started:** 0 benchmarks

See `B01_B24_TrackingSheet.csv` for detailed status.

---

## Falsification Criteria

SDT can be falsified if:

- Systematic errors >10% across multiple independent tests
- Predictions contradict well-established experimental results
- Core mechanisms fail to explain observed phenomena
- Mathematical inconsistencies in derivations
