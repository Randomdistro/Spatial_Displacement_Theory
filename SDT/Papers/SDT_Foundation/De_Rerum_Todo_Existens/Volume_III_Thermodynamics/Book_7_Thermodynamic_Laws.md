## Introduction to Book 7

This book derives all thermodynamic laws from spation contact mechanics and shunt statistics. No probabilistic postulates—pure deterministic mechanics.

**Cross-Reference:** This book builds on Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 3 (Shunt Dynamics) and Volume I, Book 3, Chapter 1, Section 1.6 (Temperature).

## Chapter 1: Thermodynamics from Spation Contact Mechanics

**Source:** Phase_7_Thermodynamics_from_Spation_Contact_Mechanics.md  
**Benchmark:** B07 (Certified)  
**Status:** ✓ Certified

### Section 1.1: Physical Foundation

**12-Around-1 Spation Contact Geometry:**

Matter particles contact spation elements in a 12-around-1 configuration:
- One central spation element
- 12 surrounding spation elements
- Contact occurs at boundaries
- Locking efficiency λ determines coupling

**No probabilistic postulates** - pure geometric contact mechanics.

### Section 1.2: Heat from Traction

**Heat is incoherent phonons = bound spation waves:**

$$Q = \int \lambda(\omega) \times \text{(contact flux)} \times d\omega \tag{III.7.1.2.1}$$

**Physical meaning:** Energy transfer through spation contact.

### Section 1.3: Work from Boundary Motion

**Work is directed energy transfer:**

$$W = \int F \cdot dx = \int \nu \langle \Delta p \rangle \cdot dx \tag{III.7.1.3.1}$$

**Physical meaning:** Cumulative shunt effects creating directed motion.

### Section 1.4: Temperature from Shunt Statistics

**Temperature is synchronized shunt oscillation frequency:**

$$k_B T = h \langle \nu_{\text{shunt}} \rangle \tag{III.7.1.4.1}$$

**Physical meaning:** Average energy per synchronized shunt.

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 3, Section 3.3 for detailed derivation.

## Chapter 2: Three Laws Reinterpreted

### Section 2.1: Zeroth Law from Contact Transitivity

**If system A contacts system B, and B contacts system C, then A and C are in thermal contact.**

**SDT mechanism:** Contact transitivity through spation medium.

**Result:** Temperature is well-defined and transitive.

### Section 2.2: First Law from Energy Balance

**Energy conservation:**

$$\Delta U = Q - W \tag{III.7.2.2.1}$$

**SDT mechanism:**
- ΔU: Change in shunt energy
- Q: Incoherent shunt energy transfer (heat)
- W: Directed shunt energy transfer (work)

**No new postulates** - energy balance from shunt mechanics.

### Section 2.3: Second Law from Coarse-Graining

**Entropy always increases:**

$$\Delta S \geq 0 \tag{III.7.2.3.1}$$

**SDT mechanism:** As oscillations accumulate (time passes), configuration space grows.

$$S = k_B \ln \Omega(N_{\text{shunts}}) \tag{III.7.2.3.2}$$

**Arrow of time:** dS/dt > 0 because oscillation count increases monotonically.

**Cross-Reference:** See Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 4 (Time) and Volume I, Book 3, Chapter 1, Section 1.7 (Entropy).

### Section 2.4: Third Law from Ground State

**As T → 0, S → 0:**

**SDT mechanism:** At absolute zero, all shunts stop (ν → 0), so Ω → 1, so S → 0.

**No unattainability postulate needed** - emerges from shunt mechanics.

## Chapter 3: Partition Functions from Shunt States

### Section 3.1: Shunt State Counting

**Each shunt configuration is a microstate:**

$$\Omega(E) = \text{number of shunt configurations with energy } E \tag{III.7.3.1.1}$$

**Partition function:**

$$Z = \sum_i e^{-E_i/(k_B T)} = \sum_i e^{-h\nu_i/(k_B T)} \tag{III.7.3.1.2}$$

**Physical meaning:** Sum over all possible shunt configurations.

### Section 3.2: Thermodynamic Quantities

**From partition function:**

- **Internal energy:** U = -∂(ln Z)/∂β
- **Entropy:** S = k_B(ln Z + βU)
- **Free energy:** F = -k_B T ln Z

**All from shunt state counting.**

---

## Chapter 4: Phase Transitions

### Section 4.1: Collective Shunt Reorganization

**Phase transitions occur when shunt configurations reorganize:**

- **Solid:** Ordered shunt patterns
- **Liquid:** Disordered but correlated shunts
- **Gas:** Independent shunts

**Transition temperature:** When reorganization becomes energetically favorable.

### Section 4.2: Critical Phenomena

**At critical point:**

Shunt correlations become long-range, creating critical exponents.

**Current Status:**

Complete critical phenomena theory under development.
