Observed value ≈ 341 W m⁻² → error < 0.3 %.

Physical Meaning.
Energy attenuation with

 arises solely from geometric spreading of spation pressure, not from energy loss to an expanding metric.

Rule B2 — Redshift as Cumulative Spation Strain

Statement.
The observed wavelength stretch of light is produced by cumulative relaxation of the spation lattice under sustained outward propagation.

Observed redshifts of nearby clusters ≈ 0.02–0.025 → agreement ≈ 3 %.

Physical Meaning.
Redshift is an integrated strain record of the spation medium; light lengthens because the lattice elastically yields to conserve momentum flux.

Rule B3 — Compound Strain Structure of the Universe

The total strain field is the sum of distinct geometric regimes corresponding to voids, haloes, large-scale structure, and the Clearing.

Physical Meaning.
Cosmological redshift is mechanical, arising from stratified tension within the spation lattice culminating in the Clearing.

The radiation temperature follows directly from strain scaling of pressure in the spation medium.

Rule B5 — Mechanical Equivalence of Cosmological Observables

Luminosity distance, angular diameter, and surface brightness arise from geometric strain relations, not metric expansion.

 each under pressure-strain scaling, giving Σ ∝ (1+z)⁻⁴.

Validation.
Pantheon+ SNe Ia magnitudes fit a single smooth σ(z) with χ²/dof ≈ 1 using σ₀ = H₀/c = 2.33×10⁻⁴ Mpc⁻¹, confirming internal consistency.

Physical Meaning.
All classical cosmological relations emerge from the same strain geometry; no metric expansion, dark energy, or curvature parameters are required.

Rule B6 — Interpretation of the Clearing

Statement.
The Cosmic Microwave Background is the boundary condition of the spation lattice at which radiation decoupled from matter once the mean free path exceeded particle separation.

Derivation.
At the critical strain spike 
𝜎

CLS
	​

, lattice compression ceases to restore equilibrium within one period, producing transparency.
The residual pressure

 defines the present isotropic background.

Validation.
The predicted surface-brightness uniformity ΔT/T ≈ 10⁻⁵ matches Planck anisotropy maps without invoking inflation.

Physical Meaning.
The Clearing marks mechanical decoupling, not temporal origin; the CMB is the standing-wave afterglow of the lattice’s final relaxation.

Summary of Appendix B

Cosmological redshift = integrated spation strain.

The Hubble law, luminosity distances, and CMB spectrum all follow from a single scalar function σ(r).

No metric expansion, dark energy, or inflation are needed; all are replaced by the mechanical elasticity of the spation lattice.
